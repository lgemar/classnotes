9/4: 
abstract machine: the meaning of a program in a high level language
	-who defines the operation of a abstract machine? Old farts. 
real machine: the meaning of a program executed on real Hardware
The life of a program: 
Brain codes -> High level language -> compiler -> machine instructions -> 
processor(CPU + memory + disk + screen) -> meaning

...Sometime a program can have "undefined behavior". The compiler can find 
undefined behavior in a program...It's possible to write programs that have 
no meaning at all...what the hell is the compiler doing when it optimizes...

Compilers think about MEANING of your program...how do we avoid the undefined
behavior...

How do you debug a program that is generating undefined behavior? 

Dynamically allocated objects: can outlive the function they were created in
	-they last for the entire time between main and free
	
Compiler fixes the location of global variables, but stack and heap addresses
are changing rapidly...making it harder to hack into your computer!

| globals -------- heap ->           <-stack | locals                 | 

Operating system ensures that read-only variable cannot be modified.
